I consider myself a "community streamer" who enjoys playing many different games from several different genres. If there\'s fun to be had, I\'ll play it! I have been gaming since the mid-1980s on the Atari 2600. I grew up a Sega kid (Master System and Genesis), moved briefly to the Nintendo 64, then to the PlayStation 1 and 2, a vacation with the XBOX 360 before the PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch. In 1999, I discovered EverQuest and became a primarily PC gamer. EQ and World of Warcraft have dominated my playtime in the past several years. I am 38 years old and live in Michigan, USA. I am happily married for 15 years and have 2 kids, 2 cats and a dog. When not gaming, I enjoy sports, wrestling, and playing the violin.')
